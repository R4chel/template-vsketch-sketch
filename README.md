# Rachel's vsketch template

Template sketch for the [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) project management tools.

This is based on defualts I'm currently using and hopefully will evolve over time.

This template adds parameters and functions I was finding myself copying and pasting as I started new projects. 

## Usage

vsk init --template https://github.com/R4chel/template-vsketch-sketch.git
