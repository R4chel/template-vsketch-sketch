# Rachel's vsketch template

Template sketch for the [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) project management tools.

This is based on defualts I'm currently using and hopefully will evolve over time.

This template adds parameters and functions I was finding myself copying and pasting as I started new projects. 

## Usage

`vsk init --template https://github.com/R4chel/template-vsketch-sketch.git <NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT>`

## Warning 
Although use with some caution. This is a tool I am writing for myself and my specific needs and use case. I make no guarentees about it working or looking the same. As my art, needs, and code evolve I intend to keep updating this. 

## Known Quirks
When you call `vsk init` you are asked for page size. This template currently ignores the value passed there.
